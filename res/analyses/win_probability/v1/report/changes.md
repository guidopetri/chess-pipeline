# Main changes

This model development was mostly documented [here](https://github.com/charlesoblack/chess-pipeline/issues/23).

The main change is the creation of a win probability model based on Stockfish evaluation in the first place.

# Motivation

Having an initial win probability model is a great start to analyze gameplay.
