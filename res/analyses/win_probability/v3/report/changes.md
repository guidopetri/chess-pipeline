# Main changes

This analysis is mostly documented [here](https://github.com/charlesoblack/chess-pipeline/issues/40).

The main addition of this model is a parallel feature named "pace of play", where that is determined by the clock times used by winners of the dataset.

# Motivation

The purpose of the new feature is to compare the player's current time to the average winner's time left at a given half-move.
